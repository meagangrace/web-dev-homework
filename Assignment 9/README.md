Ids can only be applied once per page. Class can be applied many times per page. Universal selectors are used to select an element. Element selector matches occurrences of those tags specified in the list.

I choose to use four colors because the 70s where full of colors. I choose green 7CFC00, pink FF69B4, purple FF00FF, and blue 0000CD.

For this assignment I researched the 70s because I am currently watching that 70s show so I figured it would be a good decade to research right now.
