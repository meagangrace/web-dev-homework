# Assignment 12

1- For this assignment I used a profession that I find very interesting. I am obsessed with the show Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and one of the woman on this show is an Accountability Coach which I think is very interesting so I used her as my example client. On the show she wears a lot of black and purple so I choose to use these colors for my theme.

2- Display:inline ignores the width and height and display:inline-block uses height and width.

3- For this assignment I used a profession that I find very interesting and used it to create a website with more information on how to be accountable.
