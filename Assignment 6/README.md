# Assignment 6
1- I have come across survey questionnaires after visiting a website. This helps the website to know how they could be better.

2- Text can create a text box, make columns and rows for a table, put in place holders, etc. Selections can give you a couple options and have you select one such as gender, race, etc. Button types can make it so you can submit your information, upload an image, etc.

3-For this assignment we created a webpage that gave information on a local brick and mortar establishment. I choose to do this for the place I work at which is a law firm so I gave all the information for the law firm and asked the questions that we normally ask people when they call us.
