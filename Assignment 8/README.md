# Assignment 8

1- Doing this section I learned new things like who to structure a website with color and designs. However, most of it was things that we already new but I did have to refresh my memory. These things included making a table, doing forms that included questions and answers, etc.

2- I am excited to learn more about making the website look "pretty" and look more professional.

3- For this section I started by creating the background color and headings in the correct place. Then I made the table, forms and paragraphs and then connected all 3 pages.
