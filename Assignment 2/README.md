# Assignment-02
## Meagan McKinnon

I decided to take this class for a couple reasons one being I needed to fulfill a upper division credit so this class counted towards upper division credits. The second being that I have always been interested in the internet and designs websites so this seemed like a good intro class to take to learn more about that.

I have learned:

1. I have learned what atom is.
2. I have learned what github is
3. I hope to learn how to design a website with colors and themes.
