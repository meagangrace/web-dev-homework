# Final

1- Before this class I did not know a lot about web design so I now know how to create my own website. I learned a lot about how to use github, atom, etc. Developing a website was completely new to me and learning how to create a new website was completely new to me so I learned a lot from this class.

2-I learned a lot about web design and how to create a website using colors, shapes, alignment, etc. This was all new to me so I learned a whole new topic and idea during this class which is great.

For this assignment I created a website for the Law office that I work at. I choose to do this because I knew a lot about this topic and was able to easily create a website with all the information needed.
